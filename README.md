### Professional Experience
- **Algorithmic Trading** ðŸ’¹
  
  I've first started my journey by interning on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. I've learned the back end of things. Things like wallet management, withdrawal and deposits, transfers. It gave me experience in **C#** and **.NET Development**. In my spare time I was learning about exchange **API's** and how to extract data from them. I've used **Python** for this. Extracting data and then using **BackTester** python library to make backtests and create amateur strategies on any cryptocurrency I was collecting market data for. After my internship I was hired by an algorithmic trading startup and developed integrations between the custom trading library and exchange **API's**. Exchanges included **cryptocurrency** and **stock markets**. I've also written **Unit Tests** for these integrations using .NET's unit test framework. For a short while, I had to work with **FIX Protocol** to write integrations for the stock market. Before I left my job there, I was given **InteractiveBrokers** API to work on. After I left my position there I worked on my spare time to develop a copy trading bot using **Binance API**. I spent close to 6 months developing it only to shut it down after Binance made leaderboard data close to public access. 
  
- **.NET Development** ðŸ’»
  
  Two positions I've worked in the past provided me hands on experience with **.NET**. I've also done a personal desktop application project called **BlueFunding** and ran it on a remote server that I rented.
  
- **QA Testing** ðŸ§ª
  
  My latest work revolves around writing automated test cases on **Postman** using **Javascript** for the development of the **Finanical API** of a bank. 

### Personal Interests
- **Game Development** ðŸŽ®

  In my free time I'm trying to learn about **Game Development**. My current goal is to create a portfolio and join a game development company/startup. I've done two games using Unity Engine and put them into my **itch.io** profile. Their source codes are also publicly available in my **GitHub** profile. You can access my itch.io profile and play my games here: https://ereneren.itch.io/
  
- **Financial Markets and Algorithmic Trading** ðŸ“ˆ
  
  I trade futures from time to time in my daily life and follow the markets.
  
- **Art and Animation** ðŸŽ¨
  
  I make ink sketches and occasionally make stickers from sketches that I admire. I've also done my own **pixelart** game assets for the unity games I've made on my profile using **Aseprite**. For designing the stickers I use **Adobe Photoshop CC 2015** and Adobe **Illustrator CC 2019**. I also have a dedicated art account on a social media to share and sell my artwork. 
  
- **Sound Design and Music Production** ðŸ”Š
  
  I can play guitar, bass and sing vocals. I've played in one album and one single. Lately, I've bought an **Elektron Digitakt** and learning it on my spare time. I have also made my own recordings and put them on my **SoundCloud**. You can check out my soundcloud here: https://soundcloud.com/eren-ak-3
